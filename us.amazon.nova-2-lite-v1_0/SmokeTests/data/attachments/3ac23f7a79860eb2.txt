Yes, the City of Wahkon has a formal Citizen Complaint Policy and Form. Citizens can file a signed complaint in writing about anything related to city activities and responsibilities. The form can be requested at City Hall or downloaded from their website.

Would you like me to look up the direct link to the complaint form or help you with anything else about city services?
