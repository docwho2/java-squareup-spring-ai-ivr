Yes. The City of Wahkon has a formal process for submitting complaints or concerns. You can find the details on their official website under the “City Council” or “Public Notices” sections, where they often post procedures for filing complaints, including contact information for the city administrator or relevant departments. Would you like me to look up the exact process for you or would you prefer to schedule a private shopping appointment instead?
