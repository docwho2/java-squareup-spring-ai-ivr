We have two fantastic restaurants right near the store! Muggs of Mille Lacs is next door and serves some of the best burgers in the area with a great draft beer selection and pub fare. Tulibee Tavern is across the street and offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices. Both are wonderful options! Would you like me to send you driving directions to either of them?
