We have two fantastic options right near the store! Muggs of Mille Lacs is just next door and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area with a great draft beer selection and pub fare. Across the street, you'll find Tulibee Tavern, which offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices. Both are wonderful choices depending on what you're craving. Would you like me to send you driving directions to either of these restaurants?
