We have two fantastic restaurant options right near Copper Fox Gifts:

**Muggs of Mille Lacs** - Located next door to us, this is a great spot for burgers and pub fare with an excellent draft beer selection. Perfect if you're looking for a casual lunch or dinner.

**Tulibee Tavern** - Just across the street, this restaurant serves delicious home-cooked meals at reasonable prices. Great for comfort food and a more relaxed atmosphere.

Both are within walking distance from our store at 160 Main Street, Wahkon. Would you like me to send you driving directions to either of these restaurants?
