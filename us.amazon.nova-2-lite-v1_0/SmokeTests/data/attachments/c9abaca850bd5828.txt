We have two fantastic options right near the store!

First, Muggs of Mille Lacs is just next door and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area, along with a great draft beer selection and pub fare.

Second, Tulibee Tavern is across the street and offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Both are wonderful choices depending on whether you're looking for a casual burger or a hearty meal. Would you like directions to either of them?
