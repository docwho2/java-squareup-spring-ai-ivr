We have two fantastic restaurants right near the store!

**Muggs of Mille Lacs** is next door to us and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area, along with a great draft beer selection and pub fare.

**Tulibee Tavern** is across the street and offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Both are just a short walk from Copper Fox Gifts. Would you like directions to either of them?
