We have two great restaurants right in the area! Muggs of Mille Lacs is next door and serves some of the best burgers in the area along with a large selection of draft beers and great pub fare. Tulibee Tavern is across the street and serves more home cooked meals at reasonable prices. Both are great options for a meal while you're in the area. Would you like me to send you directions to either of them?
