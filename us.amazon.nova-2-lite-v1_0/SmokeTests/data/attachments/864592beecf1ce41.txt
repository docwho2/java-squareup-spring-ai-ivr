We have two fantastic restaurants right near the store:

- Muggs of Mille Lacs: They serve some of the best burgers in the lake area and have a great draft beer selection with lots of pub fare.
- Tulibee Tavern: Across the street, they serve more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Both are just a short walk from Copper Fox Gifts. Would you like me to send you directions to either of them?
