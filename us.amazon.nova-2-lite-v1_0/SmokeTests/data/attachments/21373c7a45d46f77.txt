It's currently cloudy at the store with a temperature of 5.9°F and a wind speed of 6.6 mph. The forecast shows snow today and tomorrow, then cloudy conditions through the weekend with temperatures rising to the mid-20s by Friday. Would you like me to check anything else about the weather or store conditions?
