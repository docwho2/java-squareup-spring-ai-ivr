If you’re here for a cabin weekend or a lake day, I’d recommend Muggs of Mille Lacs next door for great burgers and chilly drinks, or Tulibee Tavern across the street for home-style meals. Want directions or more dining options in Wahkon? What kind of vibe are you after (casual, sit-down, quick bites)?
