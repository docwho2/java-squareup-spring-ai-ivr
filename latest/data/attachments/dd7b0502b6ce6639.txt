We have two fantastic options right near the store!

First, Muggs of Mille Lacs is located right next door to us and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area, along with a great draft beer selection and pub fare.

Second, Tulibee Tavern is across the street and serves more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Both are great choices depending on what you're in the mood for. Would you like more details about either restaurant, or would you like me to check our current store hours so you can stop by and pick up a treat to enjoy with your meal?
