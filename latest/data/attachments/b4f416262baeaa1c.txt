We have two fantastic restaurant options right near Copper Fox Gifts!

1. Muggs of Mille Lacs - Just next door, they serve some of the best burgers in the lake area with a great draft beer selection and pub fare. Perfect if you're looking for a casual lunch or dinner.

2. Tulibee Tavern - Across the street, they offer more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices. Great comfort food if you're looking for something hearty.

Both are within walking distance from our store. Would you like me to send you directions to either one, or would you prefer to know their current hours of operation?
