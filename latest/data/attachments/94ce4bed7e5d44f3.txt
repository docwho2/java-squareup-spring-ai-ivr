We have two fantastic restaurants right near Copper Fox Gifts! 

**Muggs of Mille Lacs** is next door and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area, with a great selection of draft beers and pub fare. 

**Tulibee Tavern** is across the street and offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices. 

Would you like me to send you directions to either of these restaurants, or would you prefer to know our store hours so you can stop by and grab a gift before heading out to dinner?
