There are two great restaurants near Copper Fox Gifts! Next door is Muggs of Mille Lacs, which serves some of the best burgers in the lake area along with a large selection of draft beers and great pub fare. Across the street is Tulibee Tavern, which serves more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices. Both are within walking distance of the store!
