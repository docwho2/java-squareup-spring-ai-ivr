We have two fantastic options right near the store! 

Muggs of Mille Lacs is just next door and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area with a great draft beer selection and pub fare. 

Tulibee Tavern is across the street and offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Which one sounds more appealing to you?
