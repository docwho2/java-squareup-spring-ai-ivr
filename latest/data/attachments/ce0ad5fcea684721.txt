We have two great restaurants right in Wahkon that you might enjoy.

Muggs of Mille Lacs is next door to us and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area, with a large selection of draft beers and great pub fare.

Tulibee Tavern is across the street and serves more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Would you like me to send you directions to either of these restaurants?
