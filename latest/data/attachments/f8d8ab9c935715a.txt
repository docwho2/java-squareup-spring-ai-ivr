We have two fantastic restaurant options right near Copper Fox Gifts:

**Muggs of Mille Lacs** is located right next door to us and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area, along with a great selection of draft beers and pub fare.

**Tulibee Tavern** is across the street and offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Both are excellent choices! Would you like me to send you driving directions to either of them?
