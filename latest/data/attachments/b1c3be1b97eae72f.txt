We have two fantastic restaurants right near the store!

**Muggs of Mille Lacs** is next door and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area, along with a great selection of draft beers and pub fare.

**Tulibee Tavern** is across the street and offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Both are just a short walk from Copper Fox Gifts. Would you like more details about either restaurant, or are you looking for something specific on their menus?
