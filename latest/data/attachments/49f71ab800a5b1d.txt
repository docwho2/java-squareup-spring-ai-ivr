We have two fantastic restaurant options right near Copper Fox Gifts:

**Muggs of Mille Lacs** - Located next door to us, this is a great spot for burgers and pub fare with an excellent draft beer selection. Perfect if you're looking for a casual lunch or dinner.

**Tulibee Tavern** - Just across the street, this restaurant offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices. Great if you're looking for comfort food.

Both are within walking distance from our store. Would you like me to send you directions to either one? Or perhaps you're looking for something specific like breakfast, lunch, or dinner options?
