We have two fantastic restaurants right near Copper Fox Gifts!

**Muggs of Mille Lacs** is next door to us and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area, along with a great selection of draft beers and pub fare.

**Tulibee Tavern** is across the street and offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Both are excellent choices depending on whether you're looking for a casual burger or a hearty home-style dinner. Would you like more details about either restaurant, or perhaps I can help you with directions to either location?
