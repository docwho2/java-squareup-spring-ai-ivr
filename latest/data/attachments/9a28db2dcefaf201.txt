We have two fantastic restaurants right near Copper Fox Gifts!

**Muggs of Mille Lacs** is next door to us and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area, with a great draft beer selection and pub fare.

**Tulibee Tavern** is across the street and offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Both are perfect for a quick bite or a relaxed dinner after shopping!

Would you like me to send you directions to either one?
