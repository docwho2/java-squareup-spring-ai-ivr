We have two fantastic restaurants right near Copper Fox Gifts!

**Muggs of Mille Lacs** is next door to us and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area, with a great draft beer selection and pub fare.

**Tulibee Tavern** is across the street and offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Both are wonderful options depending on whether you're craving a burger or comfort food. Would you like directions to either of them, or are you looking for something specific on their menus?
