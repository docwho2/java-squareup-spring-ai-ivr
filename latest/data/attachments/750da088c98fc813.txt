It's currently clear skies with a temperature of 13.4 degrees Fahrenheit and a wind speed of 8.3 miles per hour.

The forecast shows rain tomorrow, snow on Friday and Saturday, and mostly clear skies on Sunday.

Would you like me to check the current store hours so you can stop by today while it's still clear?
