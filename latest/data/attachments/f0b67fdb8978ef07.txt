We have two fantastic restaurant options right near Copper Fox Gifts!

**Muggs of Mille Lacs** is located right next door to us and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area, along with a great selection of draft beers and pub fare.

**Tulibee Tavern** is across the street and serves more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Both are wonderful choices! Would you like me to send you directions to either of them?
