We have two fantastic options right near Copper Fox Gifts!

**Muggs of Mille Lacs** is next door and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area, with a great draft beer selection and pub fare.

**Tulibee Tavern** is across the street and offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Both are wonderful choices! Would you like me to check their current hours or help you with directions to either restaurant?
