We have two fantastic restaurants right near the store!

Muggs of Mille Lacs is next door and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area with a great draft beer selection and pub fare.

Tulibee Tavern is across the street and serves more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Would you like me to send you directions to either of these restaurants, or would you prefer to hear about our current store hours so you can stop by Copper Fox Gifts first?
