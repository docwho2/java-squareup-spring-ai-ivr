We have two fantastic options right near the store! Muggs of Mille Lacs is just next door and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area with a great draft beer selection and pub fare. Across the street, Tulibee Tavern offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Would you like me to send you directions to either of these restaurants, or would you prefer recommendations for other dining options in the Wahkon area?
