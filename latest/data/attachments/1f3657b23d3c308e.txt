Absolutely! There are two fantastic restaurants right near Copper Fox Gifts:

1. Muggs of Mille Lacs - Just next door, they serve some of the best burgers in the lake area with a great draft beer selection and pub fare.

2. Tulibee Tavern - Across the street, they offer more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Both are wonderful options depending on whether you're looking for a casual burger or a hearty home-style meal. Would you like me to send you directions to either one, or would you prefer to know their current hours of operation?
