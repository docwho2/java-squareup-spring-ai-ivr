Right now in Wahkon, it's mostly clear with a temperature of 13 degrees Fahrenheit and a light wind at 6.6 mph.

Looking ahead, tomorrow there's a chance of drizzle, followed by several days of snow with temperatures ranging from just below freezing up to around 36 degrees.

Would you like me to check the store hours for today to see if we're open despite the cold weather, or would you like some recommendations for warm apparel we carry in store?
