Right now in Wahkon, it's cloudy with a temperature of 26 degrees Fahrenheit and a wind speed of 16 mph.

Looking ahead, tomorrow there's a chance of drizzle, and snow is expected on Thursday and Friday with temperatures dipping below freezing.

Would you like me to check our current hours so you can stop by before it gets too cold?
