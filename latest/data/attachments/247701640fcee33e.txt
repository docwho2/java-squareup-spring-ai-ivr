We have two fantastic restaurant options right near Copper Fox Gifts!

Muggs of Mille Lacs is next door and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area with a great draft beer selection and pub fare. 

Tulibee Tavern is across the street and offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Would you like me to check the current weather to see if it's a nice day for a meal out, or would you like information about our store hours so you can pick up a gift to enjoy with your meal?
