We have two fantastic restaurant options right near Copper Fox Gifts:

**Muggs of Mille Lacs** - Located next door to us, they serve some of the best burgers in the lake area along with a great selection of draft beers and pub fare. Perfect for a casual lunch or dinner.

**Tulibee Tavern** - Just across the street, they offer more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices. Great if you're looking for comfort food and a cozy atmosphere.

Both are within walking distance from our store at 160 Main Street, Wahkon. Would you like me to send you driving directions to either restaurant, or are you planning to walk over after your visit with us?
