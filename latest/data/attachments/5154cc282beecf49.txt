We have two fantastic restaurants right in Wahkon that you might enjoy:

- Muggs of Mille Lacs is next door to us and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area, along with a great selection of draft beers and pub fare.
- Tulibee Tavern is across the street and offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Both are wonderful choices! Would you like more information about either restaurant or help with anything else at our store?
