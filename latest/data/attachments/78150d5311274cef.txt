Right now in Wahkon, it's a clear sky with a temperature of 38.5°F and winds at 15 mph. 

Looking ahead, tomorrow will be cloudy with a high of 40°F, Wednesday has drizzle and a high of 36°F, and Thursday through Saturday will bring snow with temperatures ranging from the single digits to the mid-20s.

Would you like me to check our current store hours so you can stop by today before the snow arrives?
