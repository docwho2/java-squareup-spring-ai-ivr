We have two great restaurants right in the area! Next door to us is Muggs of Mille Lacs, which serves some of the best burgers in the lake area and has a large selection of draft beers and great pub fare. Across the street is Tulibee Tavern, which serves more home cooked type meals at reasonable prices.

Would you like me to check our current hours so you can stop by and pick up a treat for the restaurant, or would you prefer information about our private shopping experience?
