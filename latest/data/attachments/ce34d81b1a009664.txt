We have two fantastic options right near the store!

First, Muggs of Mille Lacs is just next door and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area, along with a great draft beer selection and pub fare.

Tulibee Tavern is across the street and offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Would you like me to send you directions to either of these restaurants, or are you looking for something specific like lake views or a certain type of cuisine?
