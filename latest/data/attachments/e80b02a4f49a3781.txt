We have two fantastic options right near the store! Muggs of Mille Lacs is next door and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area with a great draft beer selection and pub fare. Across the street, Tulibee Tavern offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices. Both are just a short walk from Copper Fox Gifts. Would you like directions to either of them?
