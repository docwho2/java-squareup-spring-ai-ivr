We have two fantastic restaurant options right near our store! 

First, there's Muggs of Mille Lacs next door to us, which serves some of the best burgers in the lake area along with a great draft beer selection and pub fare. 

And just across the street, you'll find Tulibee Tavern, which offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices. 

Both are wonderful choices depending on whether you're looking for a casual burger and beer experience or something a bit more home-style. Would you like me to send you directions to either of these restaurants, or would you prefer to stop by our store first to pick up a gift before heading out to eat?
