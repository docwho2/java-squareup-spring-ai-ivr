Right now in Wahkon, MN where our store is located, it's cloudy with a temperature of 6.1°F and a light wind at 3 mph. 

Looking ahead:
- Tomorrow will be foggy with temperatures between -4.8°F and 16.4°F
- The weekend brings snow on Saturday with temperatures between -13.1°F and 15.8°F, followed by cloudy conditions Sunday and Monday

It's definitely winter weather! If you're planning a visit, make sure to bundle up appropriately. 

Would you like me to check our current store hours to see if we're open today, or would you prefer information about our private shopping experience for a more comfortable visit in this weather?
