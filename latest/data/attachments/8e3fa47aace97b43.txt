There are two great restaurants near Copper Fox Gifts!

Muggs of Mille Lacs is right next door and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area, with a large selection of draft beers and great pub fare.

Tulibee Tavern is across the street and serves more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Both are within easy walking distance from the store!
