We have two fantastic restaurant options right near Copper Fox Gifts! 

First, there's Muggs of Mille Lacs next door, which serves some of the best burgers in the lake area along with a great draft beer selection and pub fare. 

Then across the street, you'll find Tulibee Tavern, which offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices. 

Both are wonderful choices for a meal before or after shopping with us. Would you like me to send you driving directions to either of these restaurants, or would you prefer to check our current store hours to plan your visit?
