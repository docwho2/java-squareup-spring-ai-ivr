Right now in Wahkon, it's -3 degrees Fahrenheit with mostly clear skies and a wind speed of 13 miles per hour.

The forecast shows cloudy conditions tomorrow with a high of 5 degrees, followed by foggy conditions on Tuesday with a high of 19 degrees, and then some drizzle and snow expected later in the week.

Would you like me to check our current store hours so you can stop by before it gets too cold?
