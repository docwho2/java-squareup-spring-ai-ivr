It's currently cloudy in Wahkon with a temperature of -1.3 degrees Fahrenheit and wind speeds of 10.8 mph.

The forecast shows cloudy conditions today, foggy tomorrow, drizzle on the 16th, snow on the 17th, and more snow on the 18th.

Would you like me to check our current store hours so you can stop by before the snow arrives?
