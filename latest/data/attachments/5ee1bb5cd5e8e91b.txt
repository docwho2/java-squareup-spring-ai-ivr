Right now in Wahkon, it's -4.5°F and cloudy with light winds at 5.6 mph. 

Looking ahead, tomorrow will be foggy with temperatures ranging from -4.5°F to 16.4°F, followed by snow on Saturday with temperatures between -13.7°F and 14.3°F. 

With these cold temperatures, I'd recommend bundling up if you're heading out! Would you like me to send you driving directions to our store, or would you prefer to check our current hours to see when we're open today?
