We have two fantastic restaurant options right near the store!

Muggs of Mille Lacs is located right next door to us and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area, along with a great selection of draft beers and pub fare.

Tulibee Tavern is across the street and offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Both are wonderful choices for a meal while you're visiting the area. Would you like me to send you directions to either of these restaurants?
