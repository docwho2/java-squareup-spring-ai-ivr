We have two fantastic restaurant options right near the store!

First, there's Muggs of Mille Lacs next door, which serves some of the best burgers in the lake area and has a great draft beer selection with pub fare.

And across the street, you'll find Tulibee Tavern, which offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Both are just a short walk from Copper Fox Gifts. Would you like me to send you driving directions to the store so you can easily visit these restaurants?
