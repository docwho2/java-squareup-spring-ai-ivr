Right now in Wahkon, it's cloudy with a temperature of 6 degrees Fahrenheit and a light wind of about 3 miles per hour.

Looking ahead, tomorrow is expected to be foggy with a low of -5 degrees and a high of 16 degrees, followed by snow on Saturday with a low of -13 degrees and a high of 16 degrees.

Would you like me to check the store hours for today or help you find anything specific for the cold weather, like cozy apparel or home decor?
