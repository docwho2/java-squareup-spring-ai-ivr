Right now in Wahkon, MN it's -4°F and cloudy with light winds at 5.7 mph. 

Looking ahead:
- Tomorrow will be foggy with temperatures between -5°F and 16°F
- Saturday will bring snow with temperatures between -14°F and 14°F
- Sunday looks cloudy and quite cold between -16°F and -6°F

It's definitely winter weather! Would you like me to check our current store hours to see if we're open despite the cold weather? Or perhaps you'd like to know about our private shopping experience that we offer even when we're technically closed?

What would you like to do next?
