We have two fantastic options right near the store!

First, Muggs of Mille Lacs is just next door and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area with a great draft beer selection and pub fare. 

Second, Tulibee Tavern is across the street and offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Would you like me to send you directions to either of these restaurants, or would you prefer recommendations based on a specific type of cuisine or meal time?
