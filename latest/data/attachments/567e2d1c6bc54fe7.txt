We have two great restaurants right in the Wahkon area!

Muggs of Mille Lacs is next door to us and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area, with a large selection of draft beers and great pub fare.

Tulibee Tavern is across the street and serves more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Would you like me to check the current weather conditions before you head out, or would you like to know our current store hours in case you want to browse our giftable food items before choosing a restaurant?
