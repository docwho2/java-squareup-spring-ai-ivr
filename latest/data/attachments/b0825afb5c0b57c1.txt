You're in luck! There are two fantastic restaurants right near Copper Fox Gifts. Muggs of Mille Lacs is next door and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area, along with a great selection of draft beers and pub fare. Tulibee Tavern is across the street and offers more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices. Both are wonderful choices for a meal while you're visiting us!
