We have two great restaurant options right near the store!

Muggs of Mille Lacs is next door and serves some of the best burgers in the lake area, with a large selection of draft beers and great pub fare.

Tulibee Tavern is across the street and serves more home-cooked meals at reasonable prices.

Would you like me to send you directions to either of these restaurants?
