It's currently mostly clear in Wahkon with a temperature of -4.5°F and light winds at 5.2 mph. 

Looking ahead, tomorrow will be cloudy with a high of 6°F, followed by foggy conditions midweek with temperatures rising into the 20s, and snow expected later this week.

Would you like me to check our current store hours to see if we're open in this weather, or would you like directions to the store?
